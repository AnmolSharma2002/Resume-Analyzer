## üìò ML Model Architecture

Our resume classification system uses a sophisticated machine learning pipeline:

1. **Document Processing:**
   - Text extraction from multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
   - Cleaning and normalization of text content

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - TF-IDF vectorization with English stopwords removal
   - Feature selection targeting resume-specific vocabulary

3. **Classification Model:**
   - Logistic Regression optimized for document classification
   - Trained on diverse dataset of resumes and non-resume documents
   - Cross-validation for robust performance assessment

4. **Deployment:**
   - Microservice architecture using FastAPI
   - Containerized for consistent performance across environments
   - RESTful API for seamless integration with main application
